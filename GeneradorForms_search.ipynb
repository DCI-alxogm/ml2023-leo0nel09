      " Key Ice Cream Market Driver \n",
      " Product launches is one of the key factors driving the ice cream market growth. The successful launch of new products will help in increasing the revenue flow and market shares of vendors. For instance, in August 2020, Amul launched Haldi Ice Cream, claiming it would boost immunity amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

An adult who has a body mass index between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, while an adult who has a body mass index of more than 30 is considered obese. More than one-third of the global population suffers from obesity and related issues. Furthermore, it was estimated that more than 4% of primary-school-age children were severely obese in Greece, Italy, Spain, and San Marino in 2019. Thus, the increase in the number of obese people globally is forcing consumers to cut down on the intake of processed food products, including ice cream, which can have a negative impact on the growth of the market in focus during the forecast period.\n",
